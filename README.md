### Stock Price Prediction and Investment Strategy Development for Stonehaven Capital
Objective: Analyze how stock prices and company profits relate for Tesla and GameStop. This analysis will guide investment strategies, especially short-selling, for Stonehaven Capital, a startup investment firm.

Process:

Data Collection: Used Python libraries to gather historical stock prices and quarterly profit data for Tesla and GameStop.
Analysis and Visualization: Examined the data and created an interactive dashboard using Matplotlib to see trends and patterns in how stock prices move with profit changes.
Insights: The dashboard highlights key performance indicators, which are important for understanding how stock prices are doing compared to the company's profit growth. This is especially helpful for short-selling, where investors bet on stock prices going down.
Importance:

This project helps Stonehaven Capital make smart investment decisions by showing how stock prices can be affected by both how well the company is doing and how people feel about the market. This is important because sometimes stock prices don't match how much profit a company makes, like what happened with GameStop's stock recently.

### Employee Attrition Prediction at Cypress Point Advisors
Problem: Cypress Point Advisors, a multinational financial firm, is experiencing costly employee turnover. To address this, the HR department wants to predict which employees are most likely to leave.

Solution: As a data scientist at Cypress Point Advisors, I developed a model to predict employee attrition using a dataset containing information like job satisfaction, performance ratings, and work-life balance.

Tools and Techniques:

Data Analysis: Explored the dataset to understand factors influencing employee attrition and identify key trends.
Machine Learning: Built and compared several predictive models, including:
Artificial Neural Networks: Used to capture complex non-linear relationships in the data.
Logistic Regression: Suitable for predicting a binary outcome (stay or leave).
Random Forest: Leverages the power of multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.

Why these tools?

Artificial neural networks excel at finding complex patterns in data, making them suitable for understanding the many factors that can lead to employee attrition.
Logistic regression is specifically designed for predicting whether something will happen or not, in this case, whether an employee will leave.
Random forests are robust and accurate, often outperforming other models in classification tasks.
Outcome:

The project delivered a predictive model that identifies employees at risk of leaving. This allows HR to implement proactive measures like improved benefits, career development opportunities, or targeted interventions to retain valuable employees and reduce costs associated with turnover.
